A small resource containing a collection of free assets for use in my scripts. These are resources that were found on the cfx.re forum for free or on the gtavmods / lspdfr website and were converted to work as a FiveM asset. I did not make nor do I own any of the resources in this resource.  All I have done is add them to this resource so it's easier for the other resources I create / use. There are markdown files in the stream folder that show the creator and corresponding resource. If you are a creator of these resources and do not wish for your works to be included here, please message me on github or the cfx forum to address the issue.
